#Understanding JMeter (from manual)
http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html
1. Settings
1.1 Jmeter Classpath:
JMETER_HOME/lib        |  used for utility jars e.g. jdbc etc
JMETER_HOME/lib/ext    |  used for JMeter components and plugins


1.2 Order of Execution
Configuration elements
Pre-Processors
Timers
Sampler
Post-Processors (unless SampleResult is null)
Assertions (unless SampleResult is null)
Listeners (unless SampleResult is null)

For these to run we need at least one sampler


2. Non UI Mode
2.1 Jmeter in non ui mode
jmeter -n -t my_test.jmx -l log.jtl
for load testing jmeter should run in non ui mode and else actual result will never come


3. Thread group
3.1 Basics
thread = 50
ramp up = 100 sec
loop = 1
100/50 = 2 i.e every 2 sec a new thread will get generate and in 100 sec all thread will be up
make sure first thread is live when last thread start to get max load

total http request = 50 * 1 = 50 in 100 sec

3.2 Running load for a specified time
http://jmeter-tips.blogspot.in/2010/02/tip-5-how-to-run-test-plan-for-certain.html
specify load thread=100, ramp= 1sec > chk forever > chk scheduler > duration: 600 sec > delay=0


4. Timer
4.1 Test Action Sampler
If we want all sampler run sequentially and then wait for 5 min rather wait 5 min after every request sent

#Testing Terms

1. Difference between Baseline and Benchmark
https://www.quora.com/Performance-Testing-Difference-between-baseline-and-benchmark

Baseline:
It is done to verify our application performance with new changes deployed
We have some set of matrix, once we deploy new build then we compare new results with our old baseline

run one case with one user i.e. sanity test


Benchmark:
It is done to compare our application performance with other competitors

2. Endurance Testing or Soak Testing
Testing an application with a high load for long time to get issues like memory leak etc

3. Load Testing
Testing an application with load keep increasing

****************************************************************************************************************

#Manjeet - Day 1

#CONTENT
A: High level understanding

1. Performance Type: Server and Client Side
>Server Side(95% used):
server shd not crash  95% use this

>Client Side(5% used):
US person accessing india site
mobile app, browser is client
how client is behaving on different browser, mobile devices with diff config e.g. ,
 samsung, lg, 2gb , 4gb ram, processor type

2. Get Non func req like performace criteria, security, acceptable error rate%, page load time etc

3. performance testing use cases:
>find SLA - response time, error rate, throughput   -- differ company to company
>Goal need to be achieved by performance testing:
what part working poorly, find peek app use hours,
business critical area in application, complete checkout process of a user
max used area - home page, srp
min used area - no need to test
find user pattern - e.g. if sale for 1 day , most keywords searched in site etc

4. Performance test strategy
>define benchmark - expected performance
>how dev design impact perf
> get load test env - replica of prod as close as possible
> what will be test monitoring system
1. server side monitoring - error%, transacting time
2. local test execution performance monitoring - error, first user last user
> what is application architecture


5. Performance type
1. perf testing : req sent by jmeter and measure result and report
2. perf engineering : analysis of issues, perf tuning, server level n/w level db level monitoring and solving if any issue
    ,code issue, code review, design review etc



6. Application type : Existing Application/ Newly Created Application
#common for both application:
performance workload model: load pattern, transaction pattern, peek load time etc
work load model
performance test plan: entry, exit, covered area, test data, monitoring strategy etc
SLA: scalability, stability, transaction rate hardware used, throughput, acceptance criteria, future growth

>Existing Application
get prod status :  page hit /sec, which page use most, high time, total user count, avg session time/user etc

>Newly Created Application(not on production)
estimated initial load, industry std, competitor hits etc


7. Definitions:
>load test:
test with peek load test e.g. 100 user/sec
which area get max hits, test that area with load

>stress level: double the load and test

>endurance test: normal test run for 8 hr, 1 day, 2 day and then gradually increase load, chk peak load for 5 , 8 hr, 1 day etc
e.g. testing for if a sale for 2 week then chk stability

>benchmarking:
run baseline test once with one use with all script
one user for 30min : decide bench marking i.e. how system is performing


8. Points to be keep in mind
> our n/w capacity: 100MB/sec, wifi, or LAN or testing on cloud, bandwidth issues etc
> server monitoring tools: DB logs, memory use, connection pooling , very slow transaction,
know issue in app, memory leak, highest utilization etc
> DB monitoring: locking mechanism - row ,column or table locking. table locking is worst
sql query - too much joins, query time, bad query design
> perf testing framework: high load test 10k/hour in distributed mode master- many node model
our m/c config type 4gb 8gb etc


Strategy:
> same test running in two day will give different result because of caching, retesting of test etc
> bottleneck in application : disk usage, cpu
> 3rd party component used: how to handle performance of 3rd party component
if 3rd party can handle lesser load than our application


9. Plug-ins
Jeter 2.13: grafna influxdb can be integrated for result graphs
Plugins can be downloaded from here: https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/




B: RECORDING SCRIPTS

1. How to record a script
Jmeter > File > Template > Recording
Firefox > preference > adv > network > setting > manual proxy > add localhost 8888 and check 'use this proxy for all protocols'
Workbench > Start Recording
open site and record calls

After recording script, do cleaning
> delete unnecessary samplers
> rename all samplers
> for one click there can be two genuine samplers, generally happens when 1st url redirect to 2nd url
> place all sampler under thread group
> remove server name from each samplers and place that inside "HTTP req default"
> Use Aggregate report > 90% line : gives better stats

note: Http cookie manager is must at test plan level other wise Jmeter will ignore all cookie and all req will share same cookies
which is applicable to most of tests

place order

2. Testing a REST call


3. Testing a SOAP call



#todo:
use variables
recording - done
rest
soap


#issues:

# practice_yepme_recording_1.jmx
1. in script samplers coming inside recording heading, if we run case then 6 hit go rather 3

# prctice_yepme_2.jmx
1. "place order"(post) button gives same url as "buy now"(get) http://www.yepme.com/Checkout.aspx
