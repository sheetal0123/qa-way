# add local repo into github
1. create a repo on github site
2. go inside local workspace folder e.g. /home/xebia/workspace/OceanWay/
3. run following commands:

git init              | initialize folder with git
git add .             | add all file
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sheetal0123/OceanWay.git
git push -u origin master

********************************************************************************************

# download remote project into local
git clone https://github.com/sheetal0123/CucumberDBExcelNew.git

********************************************************************************************


git checkout abc.java   |  it will replace local changed abs.java with last committed (HEAD) abc.java, used if you changed smthing and need orig file

#If we want to ignore all local changes and commits
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master



git checkout Fix4Multithreading
git pull --rebase origin Fix4Multithreading

git checkout <filename>  : to remove our changes in <filename>

#Pull
git stash       | delete local changes and save somewhere
git pull �rebase origin Fix4Multithreading            | resolve if any changes
git stash apply          | reapply deleted local changes

git stash
git fetch -all
git checkout sanity
git pull �rebase origin sanity


$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/bulletproofnetworks/persuit-testing.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/bulletproofnetworks/persuit-testing.git (push)

$ git remote

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ONEOKI/browser-automation.git




********************************************************************************************
#Terminology:
origin: The name of our remote repo  is `
master: default local branch name is master
HEAD: head is a pointer which always points to our last commit

staged: Files are ready to be committed.

unstaged: Files with changes that have not been prepared to be committed.

untracked: Files aren't tracked by Git yet. This usually indicates a newly created file.

deleted: File has been deleted and is waiting to be removed from Git.

add all: You can also type "git add -A ."  | where the dot stands for the current directory, so everything in and beneath it is added. The -A ensures even file deletions are included.

git reset: You can use git reset <filename> to remove a file or files from the staging area.

Staging Area: A place where we can group files together before we "commit" them to Git.

Commit
A "commit" is a snapshot of our repository. This way if we ever need to look back at the changes we've made (or if someone else does), we will see a nice timeline of all changes.

More useful logs:
Use git log --summary to see more information for each commit. You can see where new files were added for the first time or where files were deleted. It's a good overview of what's going on in the project.

git stash:
Sometimes when you go to pull you may have changes you don't want to commit just yet. One option you have, other than commiting, is to stash the changes.
git stash | to stash your changes
git stash apply  |  to re-apply your changes after your pull
stash meaning: to hide something secretly somewhere

git stash apply
git stash show      |  show stashed changes
git stash show -p   |  show detailed stash changes with code


??? try : L1 L2 L3 which file get stashed and how to get them back

********************************************************************************************

#Commands:
git init  | initializes project with git
git status  | check current git status
git add filename.java    | added filename.java into staging area
git rm --cached <file>   | to unstage added files
git add '*.txt'   |  to add files in bulk
git commit -m "first commit"   | commits in our local repo i.e. inside master
git pull origin master   |  to get others code from origin to master
git push -u origin master  |  push code to origin repo from master repo , -u is to remember these repo name,
							next time we can simply use "git push"


git diff HEAD  | we can see difference b/w our last commit(i.e. head) and new code coming because of pull
git add abc.java   | added a file in stage for test
git diff --staged  | we can see the difference b/w last commit and new staged code i.e. code changed after we did "git add abc.java"
git reset abc.java   | remove file from staging area

git checkout -- <target>   | to take back code to the 'target' commit, as we have hotch potch with code
git branch mycode  |  to create a new branch 'mycode', commits on this branch and when feature is ready we can merge it with master
git checkout mycode  | to switch to newly created branch
git checkout -b mycode  |  same as above two commands i.e. create a branch 'mycode' and switch to it

git rm '*.java'  |  to remove all files from local, as we are on mycode branch hence safe to use else no
git rm -r webdriver  | to remove folder
git commit -m "I removed all the codes from mycode branch"   | commit removed related changes

git checkout master  | back to master branch
git merge mycode   | to merge 'mycode' into master branch
git branch -d mycode  | to remove created branch, all code in mycode should have been merged into master
git branch -d -f mycode  | to remove created branch forcefully, case where some code added into mycode branch but not required now and 							we havenot merged it into master.

1. Generate a ssh key
        https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
				https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

Generating SSH keys - User Documentation
help.github.com
SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. The steps below will walk you through generating an SSH key and adding the public key ...

2. To get the code on local machine initially
git clone git@github.com:xebia/Tribune.git

3. Ask team on which branch they are currently working (e.g. sanity). Move to this branch
git checkout sanity

4. Get the latest changes of sanity branch
git pull --rebase origin sanity

5. Do your work and commit it.
git commit -am "Commit message"

6. Take the latest changes from Remote
a. Get the latest changes before pushing your work.
git pull �rebase origin sanity

        b. Check if the changes are automatically resolved
        git status

b. If the changes are not resolved then resolve the changes and add the changed files
git add <Path of file>  (To only add a specific file)
        or
        git add . (To add all changed files)

c. Continue the rebase till all changes are resolved (You can check when rebase is done by git status)
        git rebase --continue

7. Make sure the test cases are running fine locally before you push any changes.

8. Push your changes
git push origin sanity

9. Ask team mates to take the pull by following step 4.

Note: Make sure you have rebased before you push any changes and the work you are about to push is locally tested.


Issues while using push in Window:

*********************************************************************************
#Git process for rebase, merge
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing

git checkout master  	| go to master
master> git pull							|	pull latest code from remote master
master> git branch abc				| cut new branch from master
master> git checkout abc			| switch to abc

abc> git add allfiles.java
abc> git commit -m ""
abc> git push  or  git push origin abc 		|  push local changes into remote abc

abc> git checkout master			| go to master to see if any new chnages
master> git pull							| pull latest master from remote again
master> git checkout abc			| again go to abc

#now do rebase/merge
abc> git rebase master				| merging abc code with master code
-- conflict will come, resolve them
abc> git add conflict file		|  no commit is req here, only add files
abc> git rebase --continue		| again resolve conflict and keep running this command
-- repeat above two steps till all conflict get resolved
abc> git rebase master 				| just to confirm if all is ok

abc> Now raise PR from bitbucket
Note: If comment come on PR, fix them and push changes in same branch. No need to raise PR again


#MERGE PROCESS
abc> git branch mybranch
abc> git checkout mybranch
mybranch> git merge abc --squash	| to get one commit out of all commit
mybranch> git add allfiles
mybranch> git commit -m "one common message"
mybranch> git push or git push origin mybranch


git merge --abort



************************************************************************************************************

git fetch && git checkout remote_branch



git rebase
dont take pull if no code is present in remote
if taken by mistake
git reset --hard <hashcode_of_last_commit>
git push -f origin <child_branch>    hard push

************************************************************************************************************
#To clean untracked file | use when checkout branch is not working because of untracked file

You can try command to clear the untracked files from the local

git clean  -d  -fx ""
where -d can be replace with following:

-x means ignored files are also removed as well as files unknown to git.
-d means remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
-f is required to force it to run.

#How to update remote origin  | change remote origin
https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/
Note: need to change project (seleniumcode) from one repo (/user1) into another repo (/user2)

0. create a project with same name in /user2 hithub
1. go to current project folder : git remote -v
https://github.com/user1/seleniumcode.git
2. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user2/seleniumcode.git
4. git remote -v
https://github.com/user2/seleniumcode.git
5. git push origin master
it will push all code into new repo


git remote set-url origin https://github.com/sheetalrepo/WebDriverPageFactory.git

************************************************************************************************************
git push -u origin develop            |  it will make develop to visible in remote
