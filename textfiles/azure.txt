#What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers. You only pay for what you use. The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider

Azure cloud service works on Virtualization. Using Hyperviser technology it separate CPU, memory, HDD , OS and they become loosely coupled.


#Services:
A. Compute power
B. Storage
C. Networking
D. Analytics

#Benifits:
1. Cost Effective (Pay as you go / consumption-based ) pricing model.
2. Scalable (Horizontal/Vertical)
3. Elastic (Automatically resources added and removed based on traffic)
4. Its Current : Always work on latest hardware, maintainance free, focus on core work
5. Reliable: data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication, fault tolerance 
6. Global : redundant datacenters located in various regions all over the globe
7. Secure: physical/digital security


#Capital expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational expenditure (OpEx)
In standard business we need to put heavy CapEx upfront for heavy servers, config, security etc.
In cloud upfront CapEx cost removed and instead OpEx cost comes i.e. Pay as You Go.
If usage is higer then high OpEx and if usage is low then low bill 


#Cloud deployment models
1. Public cloud : Everything deployed on public cloud like Azure. Disadv: legal issue, high sensitive data cant be put on cloud etc. 
2. Private cloud : Org setup own cloud and employee using it. Disadv: High CapEx, High Skills etc
3. Hybrid cloud : Partially deployed on public and DB etc deployed on Private Cloud. Disadv: difficult to manage connectivity, configuration.


#Types of cloud services (I < P < S)
1. IaaS  
Its a Shared Responsibility Model. Most flexible category, complete control over the hardware that runs your application. Helpfull in smaller req like creating env, db backup etc
User is responsible for purchase, installation, configuration, and management of their own software, operating systems, application etc
e.g. VMs creation
2. PaaS
PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications.
Used in Development framework and Analytics or business intelligence
The user is responsible for the development of their own applications and not for infra, OS, etc
e.g. Azure SQL DB
3. SaaS
SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer.
Users just use the application software. e.g. Office 365, Skype etc
Note: In all three model, payment is "Pay as you go"

### Azure Service in Short ###
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/3-tour-of-azure-services

A: Compute Domain (Servers):
Using VMs, Containers and Serverless computing
1. VMs : Is just like a desktop but on remote. It has all features like OS, HDD etc
2. Containers: Like VMs but w/o OS. Env get ready as per App needs. Docker is one of the best platform
3. Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. E.g. sending email to customer on some purchase. Here billing comes for the time service is used.
In VM,Container we get bill even if they are running and our app is idle


Virtual Machine: Its a full computer we can do whatever we can do on actual physical computer 
.Will get ip address, username and pwd to login into it. We can ask any type of VMs.
App Service : HTTP-based service that enables you to build and host many types of web-based solutions without managing infrastructure
Functions : For specific tasks like once a photo get upload, function will rename,compress etc
Azure Kubernetes Service : management of a cluster of VMs that run containerized services
Azure Service Fabric : Distributed systems platform. Runs in Azure or on-premises
Azure Batch : Managed service for parallel and high-performance computing applications
Azure Container Instances : Run containerized apps on Azure without provisioning servers or VMs


B: Storage Domain (File System) IaaS Serivce
1. Blob Storage : Storage service for very large unstructured data, such as video files or bitmaps
2. Azure File storage : File shares that you can access and manage like a file server
3. Azure Queue storage : Used in case of task to be done in particular sequence. eg. rename file > compress > store it
4. Azure Table storage : A NoSQL store that hosts semi structured data independent of any schema
Backup : Used to store infrequently used data e.g. Data from last year which cant be deleted 


C: Mobile : To develop iOS, android apps
D: DataBases: MySQL Service/ Any DB:
E: Web : To host and develop web site
F: IOT : Comes in three model : Central, Hub and Edge
G: Big Data: Azure SQL Data Warehouse, HDInsigts, Databricks

# Azure Infrastructure 
# Azure Geography
It is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserve data residency and compliance boundaries.

Each region belongs to a single geography and has specific service availability, compliance, and data residency/sovereignty rules applied to it.


#Region
It is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network

There are also some global Azure services that do not require you to select a particular region, such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS.

#Data centre
Data centre are physical locations which contains server racks. Every regions has one or more data centre.


# Availability Zones 
These are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.
Not all Region has multiple availability zone. 

1 Geography = 2 or more region 
1 Region = 1 or more Data Centeres
1 Region = 3 or more Availability Zone

Availability Zones fall into two categories:

1. Zonal services – you pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, virtual machines, managed disks, IP addresses)
2. Zone-redundant services – platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).


#Region Pair:
Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography at least 300 miles away. e.g. West US paired with East US.


#Service-Level Agreements
There are three key characteristics of SLAs for Azure products and services:
1. Performance Targets
2. Uptime and Connectivity Guarantees
3. Service credits
No SLA for free services, or Azure Adviser

Composite SLA : Generally Web and DB SLA are different. So application SLA will be calculated as per both the SLA.

Resiliency
Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's not about avoiding failures, but responding to failures in a way that avoids downtime or data loss

=========== * ============= * ============= * ============= * ============= * ============

# Azure Management Servicem

Common Tools:
Azure portal(GUI) 
Azure PowerShell : To execute commands from Window m/c
Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) : To execute commands from any OS
Azure Cloud Shell : Interactive , browser accessible shell for managing resources
Azure mobile app : 

Azure Marketplace : App store having more than 8000 diff apps
Subscription: Azure allows you to have more than one subscription associated with one directory

Azure Advisor provides advice Best practices and security for your services
Azure dashboard is stored as JSON file and can be changed/ sent very easily

### Azure Service in Detail ###

# A # Azure compute #
Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources like multi-core processors and supercomputers via virtual machines and containers. It also provides serverless computing to run apps without requiring infrastructure setup or configuration.

#There are four common techniques for performing compute in Azure:
1. Virtual machines (IaaS)
2. Containers
3. Azure App Service (PaaS)
4. Serverless computing


1. VMs:
VMs best cases: test/dev build deployement, disaster recovery, extending data centre.

Availability Set (AS)
it is a logical grouping of two or more VMs that help keep your application available during planned or unplanned maintenance. So we need to make sure these VMs is part of diff Update domain.
 
Update domains indicate groups of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. Update domains are logical part of every Data Centre. Azure keep sending latest patches to all servers in globe and soft get installed as per update domain.

A fault domain is essentially a rack of servers. Each rack has diff power supply, connection etc. 
In case of power outage only one rack get down. 

Hence VM from AS are always chose from diff fault domain(unplanned event) and diff update domain(planned domain).

"Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets" let you create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs

"Azure Batch" enables large-scale job scheduling and compute management with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs.




2. Container
If you wish to run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine, containers are an excellent choice. The container orchestrator can start, stop, and scale out application instances as needed.

A container is a modified runtime environment built on top of a host OS that executes your application. A container doesn't use virtualization, so it doesn't waste resources simulating virtual hardware with a redundant OS. This environment typically makes containers more lightweight than VMs. This design allows you to respond quickly to changes in demand or failure

#To manage Containers in Azure
1. Azure Container Instances (ACI)
2. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)


VM vs Container
VM is virtualization of computer parts like CPU, Memory, Storage
Container is virtualization of OS. In same machine we can create any number of diff OS container
Container is more efficient and fast



3. App Service (PaaS)
Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure

Types: Web Apps,API Apps,WebJobs(Backend jobs),Mobile Apps



4. Serverless computing
It encompasses three ideas:
(a) the abstraction of servers: we simply deploy code and azure chose server themselfs
(b) an event-driven scale: auto reply of mail, everyday job running at fix time etc
(c) micro-billing: If code runs for 2 min/day then billing will be for 2 min only

Serverless Types:
1. Azure Functions : we write code for every step
2. Azure Logic Apps : we define workflow in web UI and define task

# B # Azure Storage #

# Benefits of using Azure to store data
Automated backup and recovery
Replication across the globe
Support for data analytics
Encryption capabilities
Multiple data types
Data storage in virtual disks
Storage tiers

# Types of data
1. Structured data : (relational)Data which has schema and stored as row/column e.g. sensor data or financial data.
2. Semi-Structured data. (NOSQL/non-relational) : Uses tags and keys to store data
3. Unstructured data : Data with no structure. Any kind of data.

# DBs
1. Azure SQL Database : Its a DaaS (Database as a Service) service for Relational DB
2. Azure Cosmos DB : For Schema-less Data. Distributed globally. Good if your user base is spread across globe. User will get response from nearest azure region.
3. Azure Blob storage : For unstructured ie any kind of data. For massive data, backup, disaster recovery, and archivingetc. e.g. Streammimg live video
4. Azure Data Lake Storage : The Data Lake feature allows you to perform Big data analytics on your data usage and prepare reports. Data Lake is a large repository that stores both structured and unstructured data. (Enhanced version of Blob storage for analytics )
5. Azure Files : Azure Files uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that ensures the data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Used to store and share fiels. 
6. Azure Queue : Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
7. Disk Storage : Disk storage provides disks for virtual machines, applications.
	types: solid-state drives (SSDs)(better for production servers) to traditional spinning hard disk drives (HDDs)

Storage tiers
1. Hot storage tier: optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.
2. Cool storage tier: optimized for data that are infrequently accessed. 
3. Archive storage tier: for data that are rarely accessed.

Encryption and replication
Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE): Azure encrypted data before storing them
Client-side encryption: Save already encrypted data by user



    ==================   *   ==================  *  ==================
	
# C # Azure Network #

Region

#Subnets
Each different VMs can be divided into smaller network called subnet. Subnet can have different config like public private and VMs will behave accordingly

One Virtual Networks contains mutiple Subnets and each subnet has one NSG

VM : A ecommerce site can be easily deployed in Cloud. Under single VM three subnet with diff conf can be created for Web, Business Logic and DB layer. 
Web subnet has both public ip and private ip address. Rest two subnet will have only private ip address.


NSG: network security group
A network security group, or NSG, allows or denies inbound network traffic to your Azure resources. Think of a network security group as a cloud-level firewall for your network.

What is resiliency?
Resiliency refers to a system's ability to stay operational during abnormal conditions.
Like Natural disasters, System maintenance, both planned and unplanned, , Spikes in traffic, malicious attack DDoS

# Load balancer
A load balancer distributes traffic evenly among each system in a pool. A load balancer can help you achieve both high availability and resiliency.


#Auto Scaling and Load Balancing
Load Balancing: To equally distribute incomming data to currently running servers
Auto Scaling : To Up/Down new server instances once CPU utilization increase/descrease by threshold

Vertical scaling (scale up): when increasing the capacity/configuration of current server e.g. core i3 to core i7, memory up etc
Horizontal scaling (scale out): when increasing number of server e.g. one to two to five etc


Azure Application Gateway
Application Gateway is a load balancer designed for web applications.

What is a Content Delivery Network?
A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users

What is DNS?
DNS, or Domain Name System, is a way to map user-friendly names to their IP addresses. 
www.abc.com is mapped to some load balancer ip address XX.XX.XXX.XXX

#Latency:
Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel over the network. Latency is typically measured in milliseconds. Distance matter the most for latency.

#Bandwidth 
Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can fit on the connection. 
Latency refers to the time it takes for that data to reach its destination.

E.g.: Train is Bandwidth and Train Speed is Latency

Better solution to reduce latency is to destribute azure region in globe.

Azure Traffic Manager. 
Traffic Manager uses the DNS server that's closest to the user to direct user traffic to a globally distributed endpoint/regions.

# Traffic Manager vs Load Balancer
Traffic Manager works at the DNS level, and directs the client to a preferred region/endpoint.
Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic within the same region to make your services more highly available and resilient. 


    ==================   *   ==================  *  ==================
	
# D # Azure Security #

#Encryption
Types:
Symmetric encryption : uses single key to encrypt and decrypt
Asymmetric encryption : uses private and public key

Both abv use  two approaches:
1. Encryption at rest : When data is present in some physical disk i.e. rest mode
2. Encryption in transit : When data move from one place to another (TLS layer play role)

Azure Storage Service Encryption : For Rest Data
Azure Disk Encryption : For data in VMs
Azure Key Vault : To store private/public keys, certificates


# Types of certificates
1. Service certificates are used for cloud services
2. Management certificates are used for authenticating with the management API

Azure DDoS Protection Service: Stop traffic from attacker only
Type: Basic/Standard

# Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP)
To classify and optionally, protect its documents and emails by applying labels. Labels can be applied automatically by administrators who define rules and conditions, manually by users
If some .doc file has sesitive data then MS ask to save it as confidential

# Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)
ATP is capable of detecting known malicious attacks and techniques, security issues, and risks against your network.
It leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.


    ==================   *   ==================  *  ==================


# Azure Infrastructure

Azure Policy 
AP is an Azure service you use to create, assign and, manage policies
Here we define some set of rules like how many CPU VM can be created etc and azure keep a check to audit all infra as per defined policies.

Role-based access control(RBAC) focuses on user actions at different level i.e. who can do what in azure. Like Admin, Normal User etc. But Policy defined as a given role what max you can do. Unlike RBAC, Azure Policy is a default-allow-and-explicit-deny system.

What is a policy definition?
A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what action to take 

Policy Initiative
An initiative definition is a set or group of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal.
 
Like a policy assignment, an initiative assignment is an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope. Initiative assignments reduce the need to make several initiative definitions for each scope. This scope could also range from a management group to a resource group. 

Azure Management Groups
AMG  are containers for managing access, policies, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions.

Azure Blueprints 
AB enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements



	
# MS Compliance Sources:
1. Microsoft Privacy Statement : explains what personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes.
2. Microsoft Trust Center : Trust Center is a website resource containing information and details about how Microsoft implements and supports security, privacy, compliance, and transparency in all Microsoft cloud products and services
3. Service Trust Portal : The Service Trust Portal (STP) hosts the Compliance Manager service, and is the Microsoft public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information relevant to Microsoft’s cloud services
4. Compliance Manager : Compliance Manager is a workflow-based risk assessment dashboard within the Service Trust Portal that enables you to track, assign, and verify your organization's regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft professional services and Microsoft cloud services such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.
Compliance Manager is a dashboard that provides a summary of your data protection and compliance stature and recommendations for improvement.


#Service Health:
Azure provides two primary services to monitor the health of your apps and resources.
1. Azure Monitor
2. Azure Service Health

Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your applications by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments

Azure Service Health is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues with Azure services affect you. Azure Service Health can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.


    ==================   *   ==================  *  ==================

# Azure Resource Manager
Use Azure Resource Manager to organize resources, enforce standards, and protect critical assets from deletion.


# What are resource groups?
Resource groups are a fundamental element of the Azure platform. A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription like virtual machines, Application Gateways, and CosmosDB instances. All resources must be in a resource group and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group

Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permission
Tags can be used to better organize diff resources groups


#What is Azure Policy?
Azure Policy is a service you can use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies apply and enforce rules that your resources need to follow.


#How RBAC defines access
RBAC uses an allow model for access. When you are assigned to a role, RBAC allows you to perform specific actions, such as read, write, or delete.

#Resource Locks
RC to ensure critical resources aren't modified or deleted 
Resource locks can set to either Delete(cant be deleted) or Read-only.



    ==================   *   ==================  *  ==================

# Azure Pricing

#Usage meters
When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage, and generate a usage record that is used to calculate your bill.

Billing is as per Resource Type, Location, Service Type, Subscription Type. Some have high billing, some has low.

#Usage Meter Examples:
Compute Hours
IP Address Hours
Data Transfer In
Data Transfer Out
Standard Managed Disk
Standard Managed Disk Operations
Standard IO-Disk
Standard IO-Block Blob Read
Standard IO-Block Blob Write
Standard IO-Block Blob Delete

#Deallocating VMs
De-allocating a VM is not the same as deleting a VM. De-allocation means the VM is not assigned to a CPU or network in a datacenter. However, your persistent disks remain, and the resource is present in your subscription. It's similar to turning off your physical computer.


#Billing Zone
Its a geographical grouping of Azure Regions for billing purposes. 
Zone 1	United States, US Government, Europe, Canada, UK, France, Switzerland
Zone 2	East Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, India, Korea

Billing zones aren't the same as an Availability Zone. In Azure, the term zone is for billing purposes only, and the full term Availability Zone refers to the failure protection that Azure provides for datacenters.


#Azure pricing calculator
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/

#We have major 4 tabs in Pricing
1. Products: This tab is where you'll do most of your activity. This tab has all the Azure services listed and is where you'll add or remove services to put together your estimate.
2. Example Scenarios:  This tab has several examples of infrastructure involved in common cloud-based solutions. You can add all the components of the entire scenario to estimate the cost.
3. Saved Estimates:  This tab has all of your previously saved estimates. We'll go through this process in a moment.
4. FAQ Just as it says, this tab has answers to some frequently asked questions.

#How to share estimate
1. We can save estimate in "Saved Estimate" tab, so we can come back to it later and adjust it if necessary. 
2. We can also export it to Excel for further analysis 
3. Share the estimate via a URL.



# What is Azure Advisor?
Azure Advisor is a free service built into Azure that provides recommendations on high availability, security, performance, and cost. Advisor analyzes your deployed services and looks for ways to improve your environment across those four areas

1. Reduce costs by eliminating unprovisioned Azure ExpressRoute circuits
2. Buy reserved instances to save money over pay-as-you-go.
3. Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines.

# Azure Cost Management
Azure Cost Management is another free, built-in Azure tool that can be used to gain greater insights into where your cloud money is going. You can see historical breakdowns of what services you are spending your money on and how it is tracking against budgets that you have set. You can set budgets, schedule reports, and analyze your cost areas.

# Total Cost of Ownership Calculator
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/
If you are starting to migrate to the cloud, a useful tool you can use to predict your cost savings is the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator.
Estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your workloads to Azure


# Use Azure credits
Visual Studio subscribers can activate a monthly credit benefit that allows you to experiment with, develop, and test new solutions on Azure
Azure provide credits on using its products like VS Code


#Spending limits
By default, Azure subscriptions that have associated monthly credits (which includes trial accounts) have a spending limit to ensure you aren't charged once you have used up your credits
Note: Azure spending limits are not the same as Subscription, Service, or Resource Group limits and quotas.
The spending limit feature is specific to subscriptions that include a monthly Azure credit allotment. It is not available on pay-only subscriptions.

# Reserved Instances
If you have VM workloads that are static and predictable, particularly ones that run non-stop all year long, using reserved instances is a fantastic way to potentially save up to 70-80% of the pay-as-you-go cost. RI generally purchased for 1 to 3 yr term.


# Resizing VMs
Resizing a VM requires it to be stopped, resized, and then restarted. This may take a few minutes depending on how significant the size change is. Plan for an outage, or shift your traffic to another instance while you perform this task.

# Autoshutdown / Deallocate virtual machines in off hours
VMs can be set to turn off automatically in non office hours. Generally good for QA/Dev test envs

# Migrate to PaaS or SaaS services
PaaS are cheaper than IaaS services. e.g. You might be able to move a SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database easily (PaaS), but it might take substantially more effort to transfer your multi-tier application to a container or serverless-based architecture (IaaS)

# Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
If we have Win Server licence then that can also be used on Azure Win Server . But at a time only one licence can be used locally or on cloud.


# Use Dev/Test subscription offers
The "Enterprise Dev/Test" and "Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test" offers are a benefit you can take advantage of to save costs on your non-production environments. For Dev/QA/Non Prodcution, cost are very minimal/free.



#Pricing short
1. The Azure free account includes free access to popular Azure products for 12 months
2. $200 USD credit to spend for the first 30 days
3. access to more than 25 products that are always free

Azure support plans
