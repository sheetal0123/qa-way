Turbo Capture - recording tool which generate captured images + SenseTalk code

- eggPlant uses Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to “look at” the SUT and send mouse and keyboard commands to it. 
- Uses image matching technology


#Adv:
Doesnot matter what technology is used to develop application
Selenium does not work on window based app and flash based 
independent of platform like ubuntu, window, mac etc
This allows it to test across all kinds of different interfaces, platforms, browsers, and devices, including mobile, desktop, and mainframe
